# INFOME
 Often times, especially in this political climate, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of information flowing into our news feeds.

 Infome's mission is to make give American's more transparency into the law creation process.

 Firstly it's important to review how a bill becomes a law,
 in order to understand the information you're viewing when you
 access Infome's tools.

 # How does a `bill` become a `law`?
 1. Idea!
 2. Introduced into Congress OR House of representatives
 3. Bill goes to representative or senators who meet and vote to accept or reject the bill before sending it to 
    1. House or Senate floor for debate
    2. Subcommittee for further research
 4. Congress debates and votes
    1. House OR Senate memebers propose changes or amendments
 5. If majority vote `for` the bill, it moves to the other house, 
    1. it then goes through a similar process of commitee/ debate / vote
 6. `BOTH` houses have to agree on the final version of the bill before it goes to the `President`.
    1. House of Reps has an electronic voting system
    2. Senate votes by voice, saying `yay` or `nay`.
 7. The `President` can vote to `approve` or `pass`. The President can also...
    1. Veto
    2. Choose `No Action` - if nothing done in 10 days, bill becomes law
    3. Pocket Veto - congress adjourns within 10 days after giving president bill, then president can choose not to sign it, and it doesn't become law.
